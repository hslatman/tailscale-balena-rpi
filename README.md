# tailscale-balena-rpi

This is an example of using the [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) mesh VPN on a Raspberry Pi 3 powered by [Balena](https://www.balena.io/).

## Description

This repository contains an example for running [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on a Raspberry Pi 3.
Tailscale is a system that makes it easy to manage the configuration of many devices in a WireGuard VPN setup.
WireGuard is a modern mesh VPN implementation that requires tunnel configurations to be configured on each device.
This is what Tailscale makes easy and reliable on a global scale using 

Tailscale is managed by Balena, an IoT platform for managing and deploying applications to IoT devices.
It is built on top of Docker, the Yocto project and other open source technologies.

The [Go clone](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go) of the Librespeed [speedtest](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest) application has been included as a demo application of what is possible when setting up a WireGuard tunnel configured by Tailscale. 
The `speedtest` service can be used to test the performance of your WireGuard VPN connection.

## Running

Requirements:

* A [Balena](https://www.balena.io/cloud/) account
* A [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) account
* A Raspberry Pi (this project has been tested with a RPi 3)
* [Another device](https://tailscale.com/download) with Tailscale installed

You need to create a new Balena application or use an existing one and prepare an SD Card with BalenaOS.
The example has currently only been tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 and BalenaOS version `2.60.1+rev1.prod`. 
In case a different BalenaOS version is used, the `tailscale` Dockerfile.template should be updated to use this different version also, otherwise there may be issues when retrieving the kernel headers or compiling the WireGuard kernel module. 

Using the Balena CLI you can run this project as follows:

```bash
# login to Balena
$ balena login

# push the application to Balena (or to your device in local mode)
$ balena push <application>
```

This can take a while, depending on internet speeds, speed of the Balena builders and whether (some of your) layers were cached before.

After the build process is finished and your device has downloaded the updated images, the `tailscale` and `speedtest` services will be started.
The first time the `tailscale` service will exit early, because the `TAILSCALE_KEY` environment variable is not set and `tailscaile` will thus not be able to authenticate itself to the Tailscale servers.
You can create a (reusable) key [here](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys).
After creating a key, it should be made available as a `Service Variable` for the `tailscale` service in your application in Balena.
After adding the variable, the `tailscale` service will restart and it should show logs similar to the following in the Balena web console:

```

```

After the tunnel is up, you can check your (online) devices in the Tailscale dashboard. 
You can also find the IP address that Tailscale assigned to the Raspberry Pi in the Tailscale dashboard as well as in the Balena dashboard.
You can browse to the IP of the RPi on the other Tailscale connected device to run a speedtest over the WireGuard tunnel.

## TODO

* Additional, automatically determined, tags for Tailscale
* Utilities for working with tailscale(d)?
* Examples for DNS and routing configuration options that are available in Tailscale
* Custom -login-server example?
* Nicer build process and more supported devices?
